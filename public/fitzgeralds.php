                <p>Meet the Fitzgeralds: a family group consisting of fiddling and step dancing siblings – Tom, Kerry &amp; Julie Fitzgerald. These siblings, from just outside of Canada’s renowned Ottawa Valley, have come a long way from their small town roots. Featuring 3-time Canadian Grandmaster Fiddle Champions and Ontario Open Step Dance Champions, this unique act features high-energy fiddling and mind-blowing step dancing. It is the rare combination of exceptional musicianship, incomparable step dancing, audience interaction, evident love of performing, and genuine sibling connection that resonates with audiences of all ages and sets this group apart.</p>

                <p class="feature">&quot;The Fitzgeralds are standout musicians in our Canadian music industry...The caliber of musicianship is very high- I think together they are a beautiful blend of gorgeous fiddle music, and top rate, absolutely exhilarating dance routines.&quot; -Natalie MacMaster, Cape Breton Fiddling Sensation </p>

                <p>The Fitzgerald siblings were raised in a musical household, and toured internationally with their family band “Everything Fitz”. Growing up in the Ottawa Valley, they were immersed in the rich tradition of Canadian Old Time fiddling and step dancing that evolved with the arrival of Irish, Scottish and French immigrants. Over time, they have developed their art form to include various styles of fiddle music including Celtic, jazz, bluegrass, French-Canadian, and pop. They have also explored other dance forms including tap and Irish. The siblings continue to push boundaries by fusing traditional and modern styles of fiddle and dance to create their own unique sound and style. Their creativity and passion for experimentation has led them to compose original tunes and arrangements, some which were released on their latest album. The result is a groovy and catchy new sound and look that appeals to all ages.</p>

                <p class="feature">“No group has generated as much curiosity, compelling our audience to return for a second
set. The warmth, energy and enthusiasm has hooked generations from young to senior, then the talent lets loose - pure vibrant magic.” -John O’Brien, Director of Cleveland Irish Cultural Festival, OH</p>
