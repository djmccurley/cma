                <p>The Welsh band Calan is on a mission to prove that traditional music, based on folklore and taught and performed through the generations, actually does rock. With 2017 performances in Australia and China following several months touring the US and UK supporting the new album Solomon (Sain Records, May 12th), Calan is on its way to accomplishing that.</p>
    <p>Despite the ancient roots of Calanâ€™s music, this brash, young group is comprised of a new generation of ambassadors, striving to take their sound to new audiences, raising some eyebrows with their deliberate presentation, while also raising the international profile of traditional Welsh music. </p>
    <p>The musicians include Calan vocalist, accordionist, and wearer of the clogs, Bethan Williams-Jones, who sings in both English and Welsh, and learned her style of award-winning clog dancing from her father, who was also a champion. Patrick Rimes (Fiddle, Whistle, Pipes) and Sam Humphreys (Guitar, bagpipes) In his youth, Rimes was a junior Celtic Welsh fiddle champion for three years running. Angharad Jenkins (fiddle), the daughter of harpist Delyth Jenkins and late Welsh poet, Nigel Jenkins. Finally, Alice French (Harp)who studied the instrument at the University of Wales, becoming so drawn into the wealth of traditional harp music that Wales has to offer, that she is now examining and developing the traditional harp playing methods once used by the Romani Gypsies of Wales.</p>
